        <h2><u>Milo’s Second Chance</u></h2>

        <p class="side-text">
            Rescued from a busy roadside, Milo’s journey began with fear and uncertainty.
        </p>

        <div class="clear"></div>

        <p>
            Milo was found lying near a busy roadside, injured and frightened.
            Passing vehicles and loud noises made the situation even worse.
            He had stopped trusting people and tried to move away whenever help came near.
        </p>

        <p>
            After being rescued, Milo received medical treatment and was kept under observation.
            Recovery was slow, and there were days when progress felt uncertain.
            With regular care, food, and patience, Milo gradually regained his strength.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, Milo walks freely and responds warmly to gentle attention.
            His journey reminds us that time and compassion can rebuild trust.

        <h2><u>Hope Returns to the Wild</u></h2>

        <p class="side-text">
            Found weak at the forest’s edge, Hope’s survival depended on careful rehabilitation.
        </p>

        <div class="clear"></div>

        <p>
            Hope was discovered at the edge of a forest, weak and unable to stand.
            She had likely been separated from her herd and injured while searching for food.
            Immediate care was necessary to ensure survival.
        </p>

        <p>
            During rehabilitation, Hope was kept in a quiet environment to reduce stress.
            Medical treatment and proper nutrition helped her recover slowly.
            Human interaction was limited so she could retain her natural instincts.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once fully healed, Hope was released back into the forest.
            Watching her return to the wild was a reminder of why conservation matters.

            Luna was found abandoned near a residential area during heavy rainfall.
            She was extremely weak and struggled to survive on her own.

            Her strength improved, and she became more active and playful.
        </p>
